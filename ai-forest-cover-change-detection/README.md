# AI-Enabled Forest Cover Change Detection using Multi-Temporal NDVI and Machine Learning

## Overview
This project analyzes long-term forest cover changes in Adilabad district, Telangana using satellite imagery and Artificial Intelligence.

The study integrates Remote Sensing and Machine Learning techniques to detect vegetation loss, stability, and regeneration over a 23-year period.

## Objective
To detect and quantify forest cover change between the years 2000 and 2023 using:

- Multi-temporal NDVI analysis
- AI-based Random Forest classification

## Study Area
Adilabad District, Telangana  
A tropical dry deciduous forest region influenced by agricultural expansion and infrastructure development.

## Data Used
- Landsat 5 (Year 2000)
- Landsat 8 (Year 2023)
- Surface Reflectance Datasets from Google Earth Engine

## Methodology
The workflow includes:

1. Area of Interest (AOI) definition
2. Satellite data preprocessing
3. NDVI computation
4. NDVI differencing
5. Random Forest supervised classification
6. Accuracy assessment
7. Forest change area estimation

The AI model classified forest change into:

- Forest Loss
- Stable Forest
- Forest Gain

## Tools & Technologies
- Google Earth Engine
- Remote Sensing
- NDVI Analysis
- Random Forest Machine Learning

## Key Results
Analysis revealed:

- Significant forest loss in central regions
- Stable forest cover in northern zones
- Vegetation gain in western and northeastern areas

## Applications
This system supports:

- Environmental monitoring
- Forest conservation planning
- Land-use change analysis
- Climate impact studies

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates how NDVI-based change detection combined with AI improves the reliability of forest monitoring.

The workflow is scalable and can be applied to other districts for long-term ecological assessment.
